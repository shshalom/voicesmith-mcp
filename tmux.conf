# Agent Voice MCP — tmux config (invisible mode)
# Used when wrapping claude in tmux for wake word support.
# The user should not notice they're inside tmux.

set -g status off              # No status bar
set -g mouse on                # Pass mouse events through
set -g prefix C-b              # Keep default prefix (required by tmux)
set -g escape-time 0           # No delay on escape key
set -g remain-on-exit off      # Don't keep pane after process exits
# Note: destroy-unattached is NOT set — the session needs to survive
# in detached state for testing. It auto-cleans when claude exits
# because remain-on-exit is off.
